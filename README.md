# Modeling-Wine-Quality-based-on-its-physicochemical-attributes
descriptionPerformed Predictive Modeling on the wine dataset and built five models for comparing the accuracy of predicting the quality of wine into categorical values. the highest accuracy was obtained using the XG Boost algorithm among Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boost, and Ada Boost models
